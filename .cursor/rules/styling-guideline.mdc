I want to fully copy the ui/ux style of <https://web3.career/>

All the shadcn uis are inside /packages/ui/components/

Donot use any color from yourself . instead use from /packages/styles/globals.css
Except buttons all texts should be in white color

Usage Rule
When asked to use shaden components, use the MCP server.
Planning Rule
When asked to plan using anything related to shadcn:
Use the MCP server during planning
Apply components wherever components are applicable
Use whole blocks where possible (e.g., login page, calendar)
Implementation Rule
When implementing:
First call the demo tool to see how it is used
Then implement it so that it is implemented correctly
